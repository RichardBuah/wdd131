            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
                <p> Richard Buah is a software engineer who values both continual education and creative discovery. I earned my university degree from Brigham Young University Idaho while maintaining a 4.0 GPA. Software development piqued my interest when I was a teenager, and I've since acquired a strong interest in how technological solutions address real-world challenges.<br><br>
                My professional skills cover a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including Python and C#, HTML and CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and MySQL. My technological development skills includes a thorough comprehension of visual design principles as well as database system management. 
                My proudest achievement was developing an autonomous drilling program for offshore drilling, which allowed me to combine technical knowledge with my enthusiasm for oil and gas operations.<br><br>
                My professional dedication includes expanding my knowledge as well as taking on complex initiatives that challenge my intellect and imagination. With my acquired skills, I hope to contribute to the development of innovative oil and gas solutions that will enhance sector operations while increasing efficiency. I am hopeful about what my work path may bring in the following years.
